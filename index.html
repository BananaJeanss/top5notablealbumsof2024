                    <h3><em>The Tortured Poets Department</em></h3>
                    <p>by Taylor Swift</p>
                    <p>The Tortured Poets Department is the eleventh studio album by
                        Taylor Swift, in the synth-pop, chamber pop and folk-pop genres, released on April 19, 2024.
                        Taylor developed the album during her "The Eras Tour" in 2023, with the media scrutiny which
                        inspired the record.
                        The album broke multiple records, such as the most single-day and single-week streams for an
                        album on Spotify.
                        Critics praised Taylor's songwriting for emotional resonance and wit, but was also criticized
                        for the album's
                        length and lacking profundity.
