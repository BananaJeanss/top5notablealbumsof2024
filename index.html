                    <h3>"The Tortured Poets Department"</h3>
                    <p>by Taylor Swift</p>
                    <p>The Tortured Poets Department is the eleventh studio album by the American singer-songwriter
                        Taylor Swift. It was released on April 19, 2024, by Republic Records. Swift developed the album
                        amidst the Eras Tour in 2023, with the resultant, heightened media scrutiny on her life
                        inspiring the record. Two hours after the album's release, it was expanded into a double album
                        subtitled The Anthology, containing a second volume of songs.</p>
